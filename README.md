# ü©∫ Lung Cancer EDA Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a lung cancer dataset. The project investigates the impact of age, gender, smoking behavior, second-hand smoke, air pollution, and geographic distribution on lung cancer mortality and 5-year survival rates.

## üß† Insights

- Elderly and smokers are at significantly higher risk.
- Second-hand smoke and air pollution also reduce survival chances.
- Bangladesh follows global trends but shows lower early detection.
